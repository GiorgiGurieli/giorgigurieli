        <p class="oswald-uniquifier">Kobe Bean Bryant (koubi KOH-bee; August 23, 1978 January 26, 2020) was an American
            professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles
            Lakers
            in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely regarded as one of the sport's greatest and most
            influential players of all time, Bryant won five NBA championships and was an 18-time All-Star, 15-time
            member
            of the All-NBA Team, 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and
            a
            two-time NBA Finals MVP. He ranks fourth in league all-time regular season and postseason scoring. Bryant
            was
            posthumously voted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the NBA 75th
            Anniversary Team in 2021.

    <center>><p>The son of NBA player Joe Bryant, Bryant was born in Philadelphia and partly raised in Italy. Recognized as the
        top American high-school basketball player while at Philadelphia suburb Lower Merion, Bryant declared for the
        1996 NBA draft and was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th pick; he was then traded to the Lakers.
        As a rookie, Bryant earned a reputation as a high-flyer by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest and was named an
        All-Star by his second season. Despite his contentious relationship with teammate Shaquille O'Neal, the pair led
        the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002. In 2003, Bryant was charged with sexual
        assault. Charges were dropped after the accuser refused to testify, and a lawsuit was settled out of court, with
        Bryant issuing an apology and admitting to a sexual encounter he maintained was consensual.
