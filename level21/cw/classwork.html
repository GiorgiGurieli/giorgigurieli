                <p style="color: white;">Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on
                    December 25[a] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A
                    feast central to the liturgical year in Christianity, it follows the season of Advent (which begins
                    four Sundays before) or the Nativity Fast, and initiates the season of Christmastide, which
                    historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a
                    public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as
                    culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday season surrounding it.

                    The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus,
                    says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary
                    arrived in the city, the inn had no room, and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child
                    was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds, who then spread the word.

                    There are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus's birth, and in the early fourth century,
                    the church fixed the date as December 25. It is exactly nine months after Annunciation on March 25,
                    also the date of the spring equinox. Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian
                    calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries
                    throughout the world. However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on
                    December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian
                    calendar. For Christians, believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the
                    sins of humanity rather than knowing Jesus's exact birth date is considered to be the primary
                    purpose of celebrating Christmas.</p>
