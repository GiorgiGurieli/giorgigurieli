            <p style="color: white;">Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin[f] (born Dzhugashvili;[g] 18 December [O.S. 6
                December] 1878 – 5 March 1953) was a Soviet politician and revolutionary who led the Soviet Union from
                1924 until his death in 1953. He held power as General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1922 to
                1952 and as Chairman of the Council of Ministers from 1941 until his death. Initially governing as part
                of a collective leadership, Stalin consolidated power to become a dictator by the 1930s. He codified his
                Leninist interpretation of Marxism as Marxism–Leninism, while the totalitarian political system he
                established became known as Stalinism.

                Born into a poor Georgian family in Gori, Russian Empire, Stalin attended the Tiflis Theological
                Seminary before joining the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He raised funds for Vladimir
                Lenin's Bolshevik faction through robberies, kidnappings and protection rackets, and edited the party's
                newspaper, Pravda. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent internal exiles to Siberia. After the Bolsheviks
                seized power in the October Revolution of 1917, Stalin joined the governing Politburo, and following
                Lenin's death in 1924, won the struggle to lead the country. Under Stalin, the doctrine of socialism in
                one country became central to the party's ideology. His five-year plans, launched in 1928, led to
                agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation, establishing a centralised command economy.
                Resulting disruptions to food production contributed to a famine in 1932–1933 which killed millions,
                including in the Holodomor in Ukraine. Between 1936 and 1938, Stalin eradicated his political opponents
                and those deemed "enemies of the working class" in the Great Purge, after which he had absolute control
                of the party and government. Under his regime, an estimated 18 million people passed through the Gulag
                system of forced labour camps, and more than six million were deported to remote regions of the Soviet
                Union, which together resulted in millions of deaths.</p>
